          My name is Shahbaz Zulfiqar and I am from Rahim Yar Khan. I am passionate about technology, 
          particularly in areas like software development Flutter and web development using modern 
          technologies like React and Next.js. I am currently learning Machine Learning Operations (MLOops) 
          to enhance my skills in deploying and maintaining machine learning models efficiently. I enjoy 
          building user-friendly applications and constantly strive to improve my knowledge and abilities
